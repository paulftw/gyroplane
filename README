Project template for AppEngine

Offers quick and easy setup of all of the following:
- buildout
- AppEngine SDK
- flask framework
- unit tests


Why create yet another boilerplate?

There are two good alternatives you should check out:
- http://gae-init.appspot.com/
- https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template

Those two copy source code of all the dependencies into their repositories.
I didn't like that approach because it felt wrong - upgrades are hard,
commit logs are noisy, there's existing infrastructure and tools for
distribution of Python packages.

Alternatives also package in jQuery, Bootstrap and other front-end stuff.
I think there are more appropriate ways to manage JS libs:
Bower, Grunt, Yeoman.
appengine-flask-template focuses on the server-side.

This boilerplate intends to always remain as small and flexible as possible.
Just like Flask (maybe a bit more bloated - sessions, security and OAuth are
used by pretty much any website in this Web2.0 era).


Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

# git clone https://github.com/paulftw/appengine-flask-template.git mycoolwebsite


2. Virtualenv is not required but highly recommended, because it's awesome.
I'm using virtualenvwrapper, so:

# mkvirtualenv mycoolwebsite
# workon mycoolwebsite


3. Fetch buildout and install all dependencies:

# python bootstrap.py -v 1.7.0
# bin/buildout


4. Start a dev server

# bin/dev_appserver app
and open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser


5. ???


6. Profit!
